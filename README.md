Lifetime-harvester
==================

This is a personal time tracker, a tool to measure spent time on multiple tasks. Good for programmers who work on multiple tickets and have to log their time on each task.

TODO
----

* summarize active hours
* task groups

KNOWN BUGS
----------

* Server side and client side clocks are never 100% in sync, some dozen of seconds diff could be experienced (working on a fix)
